# LargePages need to be supported and enabled by the system

# Enabling this on Linux is an advanced level task that can render you system unbootable if not done correctly.
# You have to edit the Kernel boot parameters in GRUB. There is two ways to do this dynamic allocation and static boot allocation.
# [!] I didn't see any gains using dynamic so I enabled static allocation on boot. Your mileage may vary.
