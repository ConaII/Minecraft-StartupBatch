# Minecraft-ZStartup
# "Simple deploy and use script for minecraft servers."
My custom startup batch for minecraft servers.


To enable restart.bat or the new restart merged with ZStart
Edit spigot.yml : "restart-script: (file).bat" 
ZStart also has "restart-script: ZStart.bat -restart" to give a restart message.
